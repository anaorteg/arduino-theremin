Arduino Theremin
================

Introduction
------------

A fun project to build a theremin with an Arduino-based system. My ultimate goal is to build it into a standalone PCB with an independent ATMega at the control. The source code is stored in the _arduino-source_ directory and schematics are in the Eagle file format in the _schematics_ directory. The project is discussed at the [GeekDad Community](http://geekdad.hotwired.com/group/arduino-theremin) website.

The original Arduino source code and oscillator schematics are based on:

[Academy of Media Arts Cologne - Theremin as a Capacitive Sensing Device](http://interface.khm.de/index.php/lab/experiments/theremin-as-a-capacitive-sensing-device/)

Additionally, I am looking at using a low-pass filter and DDS technique based on:

[Academy of Media Arts Cologne - Arduino DDS Sinewave Generator](http://interface.khm.de/index.php/lab/experiments/arduino-dds-sinewave-generator/)
